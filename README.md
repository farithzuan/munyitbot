# munyitbot
my own IRC Bot in Python3.

For learning purpose. Ignore bad codes in it. Writing own IRC Bot seems a good first project for me.

To-do list:

1. Add more IRC functions (identify nick, kick, ban, change topic, etc)
2. Optional SSL connection
3. Bot control with admin privileges
4. reddit plugin to interact with r/Liverpoolfc
5. many more...
